# Progress Made

> “It's not the destination, it's the journey” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

This document will contain descriptive information about the progress made in the past few weeks.  


### Week 1

- [x] Get started with Edge
  - [x] Understanding what is Edge, why is it usefull, and what is it primarily used for
  - [x] Look at existing research papers that explained Edge 
- [x] Finish weekly presentation: [Week 1](../weekly_presentations/Week1.pptx)


### Week 2
- [x] Make a future roadmap
  - [x] What exactly are we trying to acheive? - creating Edge benchmarks that'll help the scheduler
  - [x] What are important steps? - look at existing benchmarks, collect data (when running AI applications), integrate our bechmarks with exisiting ones and potentially develop an ML model. 
- [x] Using orbit
  - [x] Learning how to `ssh` into nodes, loading images, and etc.
- [x] Finish weekly presentation: [Week 2](../weekly_presentations/Week2.pptx)


### Week 3
- [x] Setting up services
  - [x] Had to set up [Prometehus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Nvidia Exporter](https://github.com/utkuozdemir/nvidia_gpu_exporter)
  - [x] Creating an image (`rahulisbetter.ndz`) to load dev enviornment on to any node easier
  - [x] Explored olllama and tried running LLMs on nodes with GPUs (Tesla V100)
- [x] Finish weekly presentation: [Week 3](../weekly_presentations/Week3.pptx)

### Week 4
- [x] Creating a pipeline
  - [x] Finalized the script that allows to fetch live metrics Prometheus and store it as a doc in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  - [x] Found a way to collect LLM performce metric information from ollama locally 
  - [x] Wrap up making a *standardized test* to test LLMs while being used on different nodes
- [x] Finish weekly presention: [Week 4](../weekly_presentations/Week4.pptx)
